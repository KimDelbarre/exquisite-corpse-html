<h1>Story about a garden</h1>

<p>This little city garden wasn't very <span style="color:#228B22">green</span> at first, no grass, no flowers.
    The only <em>living</em> thing in it was an old tree cut at the bottom. It looked dead but it wasn't...</p>

<p>And in the little tree there was a chipmunk family.
    The chipmunks didn't like the garden now that it wasn't green anymore.
    it's nothing like in the good old day's, so they came up with a Master plan!
</p>

<p>
    Chipmunks desperate for food had no choice to migrate. The local community saw that coming so they along with volunteers,
    took the initiative to restore the garden to its former glory and they were prepared to get their hands dirty.
</p>

<p>
	Each one of the small critters took one job to start with, and with some hard work and time things started to look differently.<br>
	First month was a big change, where the dirrty floors and lakes where cleaned to look like new.<br>
	In no time, the grass started to regain its colors back, while the trees became stronger. The lakes where full of life and everyone was happy to have helped in this project together.
