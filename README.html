<h1>Story about a garden</h1>

<p>This little city garden wasn't very <span style="color:#228B22">green</span> at first, no grass, no flowers.
    The only <em>living</em> thing in it was an old tree cut at the bottom. It looked dead but it wasn't...</p>

<p>And in the little tree there was a chipmunk family.
    The chipmunks didn't like the garden now that it wasn't green anymore.
    it's nothing like in the good old day's, so they came up with a Master plan!
